<p>According to Girl Scouts of America, only 13% of teenage girls say that their first career choice is a STEM career.  Unfortunately in this day and age, women of all ages fall victim to many stereotypes which can affect them for the rest of their lives.  Women are put in to a mold.  Starting from a young age, girls see what types of jobs and activities are meant for women.  This is the main problem, there are no activities we should limit ourselves to.  Women can do any activity and can perform any task they would like.  We should not disregard something we want to do just because we were taught it was not meant for women or that it does not fit into the stereotypical mold of a woman.</p>

<p>One large stereotype these young girls are facing is that they are meant to be a homemaker and mother.  The media portrays girls as always playing with baby dolls or playing with cosmetic items.  Boys are portrayed by playing with building blocks and tools.  From the start, girls see that they are limited to these toys and some very important learning tools.  Girls are often also given toys like a kitchen set or tea set to play with, while boys are given a set of tools or trucks.  This enforces even to these young kids what their roles are.  Girls are shown they are supposed to cook and clean while men do hard work.  Young girls then limit their options for their futures based off of this stereotype.  This leads to the statistic above, that only 13% of teen women want to be a part of a STEM career.</p>

<p>Girls also face the stereotype that they are fragile and weak.  Women are portrayed as skinny and delicate while men are strong and muscular.  Girls are ballerinas and teachers and cooks, while men are football players and construction workers.  Girls are not shown they can be strong and that they can make big differences.  Young kids are taught about great men and women in our current and past history, but these stereotypes always linger.  At a young age, girls then start quitting sports they think are for boys only and do not participate in activities they feel are meant for boys.  These stereotypes are affecting girls and how they choose to live the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>They way to reverse how young women see these stereotypes is not to try and eliminate them, but to instead prove them wrong.  Girls should be encouraged to do activities and tasks they see as for boys only.  They should be shown that they can make amazing things with building blocks and that they can be just as strong as the young men around them.  They need to be given tools to play with instead or another baby doll.  These girls learn from how others act around them, so it is the job of parents and teachers to help breakdown those stereotypes.  Without those limitations, girls can finally grow up to see their great potential.</p>
