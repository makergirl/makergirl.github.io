    <p><img src="/public/img/2016/03/car.jpg" alt="Off Road Vehicles" /></p>

<p>I have always loved cars. My dad would quiz five years old me on long road trips on the model of the cars that would pass by giving me his fatherly goofy smile when I would get them right. I was the type of kid that played with Hot Wheels instead of dolls and tried to fix old remote control racecars for fun. Therefore when I got to college being in a club that got to actually build cars was a dream come true.</p>

<p>I remember it was Quad Day freshmen year and I was trying to evade the hordes of people while looking around for a club that would catch my eye. There were a couple but nothing that had me bouncing with excitement, that is until I used a different sense, my hearing. Out of nowhere, a load roar propagated through the Quad, a low revving growling noise that caused a slight tremble in the grass I was standing on. I knew that noise belonged to an engine that was built for speed. I immediately left the booth I was standing by and rushed in the direction of the commotion. When I got there not only did I see the formula car from which the roar was coming from but also a whole alley filled with clubs that had built their own vehicles ranging from those of speed to power. I was home.</p>

<p>Looking around there was the formula electric team, another that raced mini tractors, and one that even built car like machines that tried to bulldoze each other over. All of them interested me but then I glanced over to the corner of the alley where a metal bar contraption with wheels was sitting. Heading over towards that car, I noticed the large wheels, the amount of suspension shocks, and the large sign next to it that said “Off-Road”. I walked up to the members of the BAJA SAE club and asked them what they did. They replied, “We design and build our own off-road vehicle and then race them through the mud and muck to beat Michigan”. Once I heard that I knew I had to be a part of this team. I am all for speed and elegance but there is something about being in forests and swamps trying to conquer the natural landscape that has always appealed to me.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/2016/03/grainger.jpg" alt="Off Road Vehicles" /></p>

<p>Over the last three years of being on the BAJA team, I have worked on various parts of the cars and have even gotten to drive them. Being able to design parts of the suspension and actually manufacturing and mounting it myself onto the car has been an amazing experience and I have learned so much from being on the team. Even now as I write this, I am working on finalizing our steering in which I am designing the entire steering mechanism using the rack and pinion technic, trying to lower our steering ratio to give us tighter, quicker turns on the track. It’s sometimes frustrating work especially when creating CAD designs on Creo and often there are times I want to chuck the entire computer out the fourth floor window of Grainger Library, but I keep doing it because I am passionate about the subject. It is the old love/hate relationship that keeps me pushing through because in the end when everything is said and done, there is an off-road vehicle that has parts that I have envisioned and created, has part of me essentially. That feeling of accomplishment and success is what makes it all worth it and is why I became a part of the BAJA team.</p>
