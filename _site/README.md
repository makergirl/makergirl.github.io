# MakerGirl

## What is MakerGirl?
MakerGirl brings 3D printing, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) to life for girls to start creating anything they want in their lives.

MakerGirl sessions are for girls aged 7-10 and are led by university STEM women. All of our sessions teach young girls 3D printing, while also teaching them about women leaders in STEM fields, innovative companies, cutting edge technology, and much more. We want your MakerGirl to come to our session and depart wanting to actively participate in any and all parts of STEM!
