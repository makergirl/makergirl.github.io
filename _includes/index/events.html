          <p>We are really excited to continue teaching girls about STEM in our programs. When signing up, it is imperative that you complete the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/o/makergirl-8181692733" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> and this <a href="https://illinois.edu/sb/sec/1346930" target="_blank">form</a>. It is also imperative that you fill out the form one time for EVERY different girl that you sign up (Ex. If Sally and Sara are sisters, you need to fill out one form for Sally and one form for Sara, but one Eventbrite can be submitted for both girls). Information about scholarships is given in the form and questions may be sent to <a href="mailto:info@makergirl.us?Subject=Hi%20there" target="_top">info@makergirl.us</a>. Looking forward to seeing you and your MakerGirl!</p>
